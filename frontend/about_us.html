      <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
      <p>We are a collective of young developers dedicated to making a difference in the world by creating practical technical solutions for everyday challenges. The healthcare sector in India is thriving, yet many elderly individuals struggle with managing their medications, leading to health complications. Forgetting when and how much medicine to take can result in serious risks, and late diagnoses can be particularly fatal for older adults. Regular medical check-ups could be life-saving, but our busy lives often prevent us from being available to ensure this.</p>
      <p>To address these issues, we have created <strong>MEDAID</strong>, the ultimate personal healthcare assistant. This innovative solution will not only remind users when to take their medications, but also notify them of upcoming appointments. Additionally, it will help track health metrics, connect with caregivers in emergencies, and provide peace of mind to family members.</p>
      <p>As young innovators, we are committed to developing tools that contribute to the overall well-being of society.</p>
